# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix mining functionality, improve admin panel reliability, and resolve withdrawal system issues.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix mining start button to properly create mining tasks and update UI status
- Remove 7-day mining duration option, keeping only 1-5 day options
- Improve admin panel withdrawal approval/rejection with proper error handling and feedback
- Fix withdrawal request creation, processing, and status updates throughout the approval workflow

**User-visible outcome:** Users can successfully start mining tasks, select from 1-5 day durations, submit withdrawal requests that appear correctly in their history, and admins can reliably approve or reject withdrawals with immediate feedback and status updates.
